hill villages. It was the market-place of the Palatine, Esqui-
line, Qnirinal‚ and Capitol, and their natural centro, when
they afterwards merged into one city. Habit and tradition
have always been extraordinarily strong in Rome, and although
the narrow valley was very marshy and continnally flooded, it
was soon filled with shops and stalle, with the memorials of
the heroes, the teinples of the gods, and the tribunale of justice.
Where the people were acoustomed to gather, there they eon-
tinued to meet to discuss state affairs and to listen to the
speeehes of orators’ (E. Bnrton-Brown, Idam-‹watifflm in the

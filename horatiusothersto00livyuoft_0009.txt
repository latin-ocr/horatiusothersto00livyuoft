 

PREFAOE.

THE kind reception accorded to the Story of

the Kings qf Rome has led me to hope that
another selec-tion of stories adapted from Livy may
be found useful. Livy's narrative has been con-
siderably simplifiedâ€š especially in the early chapters.
Macaulay's Lays of A'ncient Rome is one of
the subjects suggested in the course of English
Literature proposed for Secondary Schools by the
Board of Education. I therefore hope that most
of my readers will be familiar with the Lays of
Horatius and Lake Regillus.

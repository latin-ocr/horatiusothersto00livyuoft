CHAPTER 4.

1. dictator. In times of special danger a dictator or
‘commander‚’ also called mayister populi, was appointed. His
power superseded most of the ordinary functione of the con-
suls, being a temporary revival of the kingly power. As in
early times the special danger was always a military one, the
duration of his office was limited to the six months of the
summer campaign; but he was expected to hold office only so
long as the danger lasted. cf. c. 14, 1. 19—30.

2. magister equitum, an officer appointed by the dictator ’

to command the cavalry, the dictator himself being regarded
as the commander of the infantry force.

Introduction xv

Which you do live up0n3 and fit it is,

Because 1 am tho storo-house and the shop

Of the whole body; but, if you do remelnber,

I send it through the rivers of your blood,

Even to the court, the beart, to the seat o' the brain3
And, through the cranks ancl offices of man,

The strongest nerves and small inferior veins

From me receive that natural competency

Whereby they live.'

The history of Coriolanus is given in chs. 6—8.
Critics have shown that much of it is highly
improbable. In Livy's narrative We read a fine
tragedy; in Shakespeare's play a finer tragedy
still. Discrepancies between Livy and Shakespeare
are easily explained. Shakespeare followed Plu-
tarch's Life of Coriolanus; in his Greek and
Roman plays he made great use of North's
translation of Plutarch's Lives.

The interesting story of Fidenae (chs. 11—16)
contains several vigorous battle-pieces. We have
now advanced nearly a century into the history
of the Roman Republic3 but Livy is still writing
as a novelist rather than a historian. Though we
can place little confidence in the details of his
story, of this striking fact we may be certain,—
that for a long period the City, which at no
distant date was to be mistress of the civilised
world, was constantly fighting for her life against
near neighbours. The most powerful of these was
Veii, which was only twelve miles from Rome.
